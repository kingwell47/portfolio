      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        For the past 6 years I have been working as a Team Manager for a BPO
        company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, I have re-discovered my passion for Web Development dating
        back from the days of Friendster Overlays that modified that siteâ€™s look
        based on custom CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then I have been learning all I can about subjects like CSS,
        Reactjs, Express, Nextjs, etc. and building projects from sites like
        Front End Mentor in my spare time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is the culmination of everything that I learned and hope to
        put into practice.
      </p>
