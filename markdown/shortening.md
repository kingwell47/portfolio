## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Picked this one as API practice and it was really fun overall!

```js
async function getShortenenedUrl(originalUrl) {
  const response = await fetch(
    "https://api.shrtco.de/v2/shorten?url=" + originalUrl
  );
  const { ok, error, result } = await response.json();
  if (ok) {
    return handleSuccess({
      originalUrl: "https://" + originalUrl,
      shortUrl: result.full_short_link2,
    });
  } else {
    return handleError(error);
  }
}
```

Using "clamp" for font-sizing makes responsive text way easier:

```scss
&__title {
  font-size: clamp(fnc.rem(40), 6vw, fnc.rem(80));
  color: var(--color-neutral-300);
}
```

Handling errors is one of the things I really wanted to learn about:

```js
const handleError = (errMessage) => {
  setError(true);
  setProcessing(false);
  if (errMessage === undefined) return setErrorMessage("Please add a link");
  setErrorMessage(errMessage);
};
```

### Continued development

Adding an animation for the "Shorten it!" button seems like a good place to improve this design.

### Useful resources

- [min(), max(), and clamp() are CSS magic! by Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VF-4euyRo) - Using these functions made the design the most responsive one I've coded yet.
- [Easier Error Handling Using async await in JavaScript by Jesse Warden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iiZHlT0boc) - This video helped me figure out how to handle the API responses and set-up error handling.
- [Using Async/Await with the Fetch API - JavaScript Tutorial by Dcode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp9KIcSKTNo) - Good instructions on how to set-up the Fetch function for this API.
- [useLocalStorage from useHooks.com](https://usehooks.com/useLocalStorage/) - Used to set up storing past shortened links.
